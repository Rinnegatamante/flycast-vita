# Marvel vs. Capcom 2 (US v1.001) Vita optimization ledger

Status: functional boot confirmed; no representative performance baseline has
been collected yet.

## Fixed target identity

- Branch: `codex/game-marvel-vs-capcom-2`
- Neutral base: `origin/loop-instrumentation` at
  `178e408df1d7553c236fa52d770d64a0005a6920`
- Guest content:
  `ux0:data/marvel/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!].gdi`
- Disc description: Dreamcast, NTSC-US, revision v1.001. The supplied GDI and
  all three referenced tracks were present for the first functional boot.
- Runtime product ID: `T1212N`, confirmed by the `Game ID is [T1212N]` message
  in the first-boot console artifact. Product-specific code must match this ID
  and the supplied revision; do not infer addresses from another dump.
- Target Manager DevKit:
  `39829e00451207db324731441501004d` (local default target)
- Vita title/process ID: `FLYCASTDC`

All game addresses, product IDs, controller automation and destructive
compatibility assumptions belong on this branch only.

## Reproducible build

Iteration builds use Release mode, symbols enabled and LTO disabled. The first
build creates the worktree-private vitaGL copy with the required flags embedded
by `scripts/build-vita.ps1`:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-vita.ps1 -BuildType Release -BuildDir build-vita `
  -VitaGLDir F:\Ubuntu\vitaGL -SDLDir F:\Ubuntu\SDL `
  -BuildVitaGL -Symbols
```

Pinned build dependency:

- `core/deps/libchdr`: `7972daa6ca6bf631bf54d60c5ed09eb76472bb79`

The build also copies the generated `Flycast.vpk_param.sfo` beside the SELF as
`build-vita/sce_sys/param.sfo`. It parses the copied SFO and fails unless
`ATTRIBUTE2` is the 32-bit integer `12`.

Enable `VITA_JIT_RUN_PROFILE` only for runs intended to collect guest block
entry counts. Preserve the exact unstripped ELF and its SHA-256 beside every
profile. Test LTO only as a final A/B comparison.

## Baseline setup

Before changing the target configuration, copy the current
`ux0:data/flycast/emu.cfg` into the run artifacts. Then set exactly:

```ini
[config]
Dreamcast.AutoStartContent = ux0:data/marvel/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!].gdi
```

The pre-run target configuration is preserved at
`build-vita/devkit-config-backups/mvc2-first-launch/emu.cfg.before-mvc2`
(SHA-256 `BC4092934D10869568CA1EC0010839024ACBF19341660CE34352771DD954FC35`).
The applied config changed the autostart path and disabled `RazorAutoCapture`
and `RazorFrameSync` for a non-profiled functional run; its SHA-256 is
`5BEA28568B366DEB67513D348DEA993A167F09E5E50CC6DEB116868EBA3A20FB`.

The initial workload is not yet fixed. Prefer a Target Manager controller
recording that reaches and plays a representative match over an uncontrolled
attract sequence. The recording identity, playback trigger, completion marker
or fixed observation duration must be added here before comparing builds.

Full speed means guest/game time tracks wall time for the same scene, with
continuous correctly paced audio, stable animation/input cadence and no visual
corruption or delayed failure. Host frame rate alone is not sufficient.

## Retained measurements

| Candidate | Build/ELF SHA-256 | Workload | Cold/repeated runs | Guest vs wall time | Audio/game speed | Visual/XML outcome | Profiles | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functional boot | C++ tree `0344626cd`; SFO workflow `b11ececfa`; ELF `B142C2C3FDF483CB27AB9C48D5ADE6B6ACDD6BDFF5BD6058D6956FC283C2B9A3` | Fresh process, no input, fixed 60 s window | One run; cache state not characterized | Not measured | Audio not captured; 60 FPS overlay is not a speed measurement | Reached `PRESS START BUTTON`; expected `ProcessKilled`; no crash/abort marker. Black side wedges during the title effect need an A/B check with the widescreen hack disabled. | None; Razor disabled | Boot passes only; not a performance baseline |

First-boot artifacts are under
`build-vita/devkit-logs/mvc2-first-boot/20260830-164948/run-001/`:

- `flycast.velf`: SHA-256
  `B142C2C3FDF483CB27AB9C48D5ADE6B6ACDD6BDFF5BD6058D6956FC283C2B9A3`

  `0106D568E3DC48228DE1A4AF779D2B4DAD9FE5DA393170ED826037A44A4038F0`
- `console.txt`, `run.xml`, `final.bmp` and the exact applied `emu.cfg`

## Next evidence gate

1. Create a repeatable controller recording for a representative match.
2. Capture a cold baseline with console, XML exit log, screenshot, exact ELF
   hash, guest-time progression and wall time.
3. Verify audio continuity and game cadence during that workload.
4. A/B the visible title-screen side wedges with the widescreen hack disabled.
5. State the first falsifiable bottleneck hypothesis only after that baseline.
