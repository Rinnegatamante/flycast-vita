# Marvel vs. Capcom 2 (US v1.001) Vita optimization ledger

Status: deterministic framedrop savestate established; baseline, host profile
and guest-block profile collected. The first retained branch specialization
enables the NEON SH4 FPU path for `T1212N`, improving guest-time throughput by
2.78% in this workload. This is not yet evidence of full-speed or whole-game
correctness.

## Fixed target identity

- Branch: `codex/game-marvel-vs-capcom-2`
- Neutral base: `origin/loop-instrumentation` at
  `178e408df1d7553c236fa52d770d64a0005a6920`
- Guest content:
  `ux0:data/marvel/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!].gdi`
- Disc description: Dreamcast, NTSC-US, revision v1.001. The supplied GDI and
  all three referenced tracks were present for the first functional boot.
- Runtime product ID: `T1212N`, confirmed by the `Game ID is [T1212N]` message
  in the first-boot console artifact. Product-specific code must match this ID
  and the supplied revision; do not infer addresses from another dump.
- Target Manager DevKit:
  `39829e00451207db324731441501004d` (local default target)
- Vita title/process ID: `FLYCASTDC`

All game addresses, product IDs, controller automation and destructive
compatibility assumptions belong on this branch only.

## Reproducible build

Iteration builds use Release mode, symbols enabled and LTO disabled. The first
build creates the worktree-private vitaGL copy with the required flags embedded
by `scripts/build-vita.ps1`:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-vita.ps1 -BuildType Release -BuildDir build-vita `
  -VitaGLDir F:\Ubuntu\vitaGL -SDLDir F:\Ubuntu\SDL `
  -BuildVitaGL -Symbols
```

Pinned build dependency:

- `core/deps/libchdr`: `7972daa6ca6bf631bf54d60c5ed09eb76472bb79`

The build also copies the generated `Flycast.vpk_param.sfo` beside the SELF as
`build-vita/sce_sys/param.sfo`. It parses the copied SFO and fails unless
`ATTRIBUTE2` is the 32-bit integer `12`.

Enable `VITA_JIT_RUN_PROFILE` only for runs intended to collect guest block
entry counts. `scripts/build-vita.ps1 -JitRunProfile` makes this diagnostic
configuration explicit and reproducible. Preserve the exact pre-conversion
ELF and converted VELF beside every profile. Test LTO only as a final A/B
comparison.

## Baseline setup

Before changing the target configuration, copy the current
`ux0:data/flycast/emu.cfg` into the run artifacts. Then set exactly:

```ini
[config]
Dreamcast.AutoStartContent = ux0:data/marvel/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!].gdi
```

The pre-run target configuration is preserved at
`build-vita/devkit-config-backups/mvc2-first-launch/emu.cfg.before-mvc2`
(SHA-256 `BC4092934D10869568CA1EC0010839024ACBF19341660CE34352771DD954FC35`).
The applied config changed the autostart path and disabled `RazorAutoCapture`
and `RazorFrameSync` for a non-profiled functional run; its SHA-256 is
`5BEA28568B366DEB67513D348DEA993A167F09E5E50CC6DEB116868EBA3A20FB`.

The fixed workload is savestate slot 6 at a reported framedrop during the
Ruby Heart versus Captain America match on the Abyss stage:

- target state:
  `ux0:/data/flycast/data/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!]_6.state`
- preserved state:
  `build-vita/workloads/marvel-vs-capcom-2/framedrop-slot-6/Marvel vs. Capcom 2 v1.001 (2000)(Capcom)(NTSC)(US)[!]_6.state`
- size: 10,264,261 bytes
- SHA-256:
  `10F53EDAAB5DD2E5F0CB70115F7164C2EC305FDE63F57DC21CAA8959E77A4DA5`
- baseline autoload config SHA-256:
  `69C99B54B98C4A1308C6E420C579FFEFDB1FCB086719D4800FA1F439CC0D3C60`
- autoload settings: `Dreamcast.AutoLoadState=yes`,
  `Dreamcast.AutoSaveState=no`, `Dreamcast.SavestateSlot=6`

The state and config were copied back from the target and matched byte for
byte. Every measured run begins at RTC `1988906533`, which independently
confirms that the same guest state was restored. Timing runs use a fixed 30 s
host observation window and the `emu-second` log marker. Occam runs use the
same state but a 20 s host-driven sample window.

Full speed means guest/game time tracks wall time for the same scene, with
continuous correctly paced audio, stable animation/input cadence and no visual
corruption or delayed failure. Host frame rate alone is not sufficient.

## Host profile

The accepted baseline PC-sample trace is under
`build-vita/devkit-logs/occam/mvc2-state-host-driven-pc/`. It contains the
exact raw ELF, converted VELF, `.rzr` capture and XML export. The 20 s capture
contains 4,923,092 samples in the application ELF range. The leading functions
are:

| Function | Samples | Percent |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| generated `SH4_TCB` | 2,035,247 | 41.34% |
| `TAParserTempl<...>::ta_poly_data<5,2>` | 472,772 | 9.60% |
| `make_index` | 317,528 | 6.45% |
| generated ARM7/AICA code | 244,928 | 4.98% |
| paletted twiddled texture conversion | 215,889 | 4.39% |
| `ta_vtx_data32` | 189,980 | 3.86% |
| `__udivmoddi4` | 119,192 | 2.42% |
| `AICA_Sample32` | 115,733 | 2.35% |

The candidate was re-profiled under
`build-vita/devkit-logs/occam/mvc2-state-neon-pc/`. Its 4,936,064 samples keep
the same leading order (`SH4_TCB` 41.40%, TA polygon parsing 9.70%,
`make_index` 6.47%). These percentages are relative to a fixed wall-time
window, so they do not by themselves quantify the already measured throughput
gain.

Target-triggered Occam attempts are rejected evidence. With
`RazorAutoCapture`/`RazorFrameSync` enabled, the process stopped with
`STOP_REASON_EXCEPTION_DATA_ABORT` when capture began. One attach attempt also
conflicted with `psp2run /debug`. Direct Occam loading still reproduced the
abort, while host-driven capture with both hooks disabled completed normally.
The current reliable workflow therefore uses `devkit-game-loop.ps1 -NoDebug`
plus `capture-vita-profile.ps1 -NoTargetTrigger`. Do not treat the failed
captures as workload crashes.

## Guest JIT profile

The diagnostic build used `VITA_JIT_RUN_PROFILE=ON`, symbols on and LTO off.
Artifacts are under
`build-vita-jit-profile/devkit-logs/mvc2-state-jit-profile/20260830-173155/run-001/`:

- raw ELF:
  `E9E7E20FEFD512D7DBA726007E79D66D70E67B5C993889C43C4D9C07D1BD9BFC`
- converted VELF:
  `F97117F6AD996B272810054B15C28BD3BD3F11D30F8A37FABAD5C43A2EE8FF7B`
- `jit_blocks.txt`:
  `757303ECE3D02C014D9C50685064E72A215B2EAE5C3A2103C1DE561E51512F11`
- `sh4_main_ram.bin`:
  `FF9873644C62BBB98BC98B46C20870EB69239204375A304EA618F8488DAC3031`

The profiler reset at guest second 15, measured for 15 guest seconds, wrote
6,842 blocks and dumped the matching 2 MiB of main RAM. Ranking by
`runs * generated host opcodes` concentrates work in these guest clusters:

- `0x8C12FDB6..0x8C12FF9C`: vertex transformation/submission using `ftrv`,
  `fipr`, `fdiv` and store-queue `pref`;
- `0x8C02DEC6` and `0x8C0354D4..0x8C035514`: very high-frequency short blocks;
- `0x8C18F7E0` and `0x8C19161A..0x8C19162E`: high-frequency timing/control
  loops;
- `0x8C1291DC..0x8C1293FF`: unrolled SH4 integer division routines.

This ranking is a candidate locator, not instruction-level host timing.

## Rejected iteration: integer TA vertex classification

Hypothesis: `make_index` spends meaningful critical-path time in the seven
VFP comparisons used by `is_vertex_inf`. Baseline disassembly and per-PC
Occam hits located most of its samples in or around the coordinate-validation
loop (`0x81587200..0x8158726c`).

The candidate replaced the NaN/huge-coordinate checks with unsigned IEEE-754
bit comparisons against `0x7dcca14b` (`3.4e37f`). It retained the floating-point
`z < 0` comparison to preserve negative-zero and host flush-to-zero behavior
for negative denormals. Scalar `memcpy` bit casts compiled without temporary
stack copies, leaving one VFP comparison on the ordinary vertex path instead
of seven. The surrounding function nevertheless needed more integer-register
spills. No invalid-vertex handling was removed.

A host differential test, compiled with `g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -fno-fast-math`,
passed 1,017,576 triples per mode with denormals both preserved and flushed.
It includes all combinations of 26 edge bit patterns plus one million
deterministic random triples. This is predicate evidence, not a substitute
for the Vita gameplay run.

Both target state and config were re-read before the candidate runs and
still matched the fixed workload hashes. Results:

| Build | Guest/wall ratios | Mean | Population standard deviation | Decision |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Integer-classification candidate | 0.818498, 0.821440, 0.821102 | 0.820347 | 0.001314 | Reject: no measured improvement |
| Rebuilt NEON control after reverting candidate | 0.823766, 0.823172, 0.824275 | 0.823738 | 0.000451 | Keep as current branch build |

The candidate is 0.412% slower than the contemporary control. All six runs
restored RTC `1988906533`, advanced 16 guest seconds between measured markers,
ended with the expected `ProcessKilled`, and produced coherent match frames.
Audio was not captured. The source change was fully reverted; reducing this
local instruction count did not improve this workload's critical path.

## Next evidence gate

1. Prioritize the SH4 vertex-transform/submission cluster at
   `0x8C12FDB6..0x8C12FF9C` against the NEON baseline. Any HLE replacement must
   first prove complete register/memory residue, dynamic cycle accounting and
   revision-specific CRC, with a normal-JIT fallback on mismatch.
2. Capture audio or perform a supervised listening pass before claiming that
   game-speed improvement preserves pacing.
3. Exercise additional heavy matches/stages; this one savestate is not a
   whole-game correctness result.
4. Re-profile every retained material change and perform final LTO-on versus
   LTO-off A/B only after representative gameplay is full speed.
